                    <p class="description">Gas-powered vehicles have a very big impact on the environment due to their emissions. The process of powering a car using gasoline releases pollutants like carbon dioxide (CO2).  Also, the use of gasoline not only in the car itself but when it is pumped from the underground sources, also has environmental impact, including water pollution. Result is gas-powered vehicles are a major pollutant production chambers.</p>

                    <p class="description">Another downside of gas-powered vehicles is their dependence on limited resources like fossil fuel. Gasoline is made from raw, freshly pumped oil, a very very limited resource which rif=ght now is still found in big capacities but not for long. Resource that is becoming very quickly rare. As oil reserves become smaller and smaller with every day,  only solution is use of alternative energy sources, such as electricity and hydrogen, andx yes hydrogen car exists but with a lot of trouble.</p>

                    <p class="description">Finally, gas-powered vehicles generally require more maintenance and have higher operating costs compared to their electric vehicles. Gas vehicle engines have numerous moving parts that are unfortunately wearing out quickly, needs regular maintenance and repairs. Components like the engine, transmission, and exhaust system require periodic servicing, which can be costly and time-consuming. Additionally, gas-powered vehicles are less efficient in converting fuel into usable energy which I explained on the EV page and is called regenerative braking, resulting in lower fuel economy and higher fuel expenses over time. In contrast, electric vehicles have fewer moving parts and are more energy-efficient, leading to lower maintenance and operating costs.</p>

                    <p class="description">Gas-powered vehicles are known for having longer-lasting parts compared to some alternatives like what we discussed electric vehicles. The well-established internal combustion engine (Regular engine used in gas powered vehicles) has been modified over many years, resulting in components that are durable and reliable. Leads to a less frequent replacement of major components, leading to lower overall production needs for spare parts. Also decreases the needed level of production.</p>
